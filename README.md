# CSCI412 - Assignment 1
This app meets the following criteria laid out in the instructions document:
- You must use Android Studio to create the app
- Must have at least two activities
- The main screen/activity should display your full name and student ID
- The second activity should list mobile software engineering challenges

It is a very simple app that launches to the main activity with my name and student ID, and allows you to go to another activity that lists problems with mobile development.

## Tools
I used Android Studio to create this Project. With permission, I also built it with Jetpack Compose which is a stateless, declarative framework for building Android apps in Kotlin. There are a few extra features I added like backwards navigation, both with OS navigation and buttons in the app, as well as styling. In order to run the app, clone it and open it in Android Studio. It should be able to handle the build process and runtime for you. Thanks!
